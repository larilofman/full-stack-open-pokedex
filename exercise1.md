A Python application can be linted for example with pylint, flake8 or pep8, configured however seen fit for the team and project. Robot, the testing framework for python can be used for developing the project in a test-driven manner while unit testing can be done with the library unittest or someting similar if needed. Building and packaging depends on the type of the project but packages or distributions can be built with setuptools. It is likely better to containerize the application so it's always ran in same environment with same parameters.

The way CI should be set up depends on the project. In case a lot of computing is needed(for example in the case of an AI project) a self-hosted option might be better as more processing power could be added to the server. In addition to Jenkins there are some options like TeamCity and Gitlab CI. With a lighter project, say a website made with Django or Flask, cloud based CI option would work just fine in which case options like Travis or CircleCI are worth considering, latter providing a flawless integration with systems like AWS, Google Cloud and Heroku. Price of the CI service should also be considered as some of them can get quite costly for bigger commercial projects.
